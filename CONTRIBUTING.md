# Pull Requests

Pull requests should be made against the `devel` branch.

# Coding Guidelines

In general, I follow strict pep8 and pyflakes.  All code must pass these tests.

# Permitted Python Modules

Only modules included in the standard library are permitted for use in this application.  This application should not be dependent on any 3rd party modules that would need to be installed external to just Python itself.

# Testing

Currently there are no tests, but they are planned.
